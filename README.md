# NEWSAPP

The content has been updated in the master branch 
The app has been made using nodejs express and react js

client and server-side has been bifurcated for modularisation
and have their respective docker files 

the local host for the client is Port:3000

the local host for the server is port:5000

I have implemented:

1. Search

2. sports/politics/.. etc button for API calls

3. a subscribe bar to store email IDs of users which would be further used to send newsletters (haven't completed the sending part)

4. Not much work has been done on the design part (will be updated eventually)

Dockerization has been done 
would share the link : (here)
after deployment


Cheers !!
